# Machine-Learning-coursera

These are the exercise solution to the Machine Learning course on Coursera. I audited this course and completed it in 22 days(even with some breaks).

Note to anyone finding solutions on the internet and comes across this Github repository, please don't copy-paste the answer. It won't help you understand the concept that course videos want to convey. If you don't understand, please do go to the discussion forum to clear your doubts. 

Lastly, if you could do Week 6 assignments on your own without any help, you are going right, and (Spoiler alert!) upcoming exercises are elementary.

Thank you for visiting this repository.
